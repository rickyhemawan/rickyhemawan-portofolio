        <h3>Motivation on joining hackathon</h3>
        <p>
          During my university years, I participated in a hackathon to enjoy
          myself, as I found exploring and developing applications in Flutter to
          be one of my favored pastimes, given its novelty and contemporary
          appeal.

        <h3>Final Project</h3>
        <p>
          For my university`&apos;`s final project, I developed the Fresto App.
          The central concept revolves around creating a restaurant reservation
          application. One of its notable functionalities is the provision for
          restaurants to optionally receive notifications indicating the
          customer`&apos;`s estimated arrival time, allowing them to prepare
          meals promptly, even if the customer arrives slightly later than the
          initially scheduled reservation time.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my university`&apos;`s final project, I engineered a sophisticated
          system integrating both backend and mobile development. This endeavor
          leveraged a comprehensive tech stack, including Flutter and Node.js,
          alongside Express.js, Google Maps API, and Firebase. It`&apos;`s worth
          noting that I independently acquired proficiency in each of these
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I produced comprehensive design documents, including
          flow diagrams, database-related diagrams, and various other
          schematics. This aspect of the project is particularly significant, as
          it has proven to be instrumental throughout my career in software
          engineering.
