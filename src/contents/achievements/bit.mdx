### Final Project

For my university's final project, I developed the Fresto App. The central concept revolves around creating a restaurant reservation application. One of its notable functionalities is the provision for restaurants to optionally receive notifications indicating the customer's estimated arrival time, allowing them to prepare meals promptly, even if the customer arrives slightly later than the initially scheduled reservation time.

I engineered a sophisticated system integrating both backend and mobile development. This endeavor leveraged a comprehensive tech stack, including Flutter and Node.js, alongside Express.js, Google Maps API, and Firebase. It's worth noting that I independently acquired proficiency in each of these technologies.

Additionally, I produced comprehensive design documents, including flow diagrams, database-related diagrams, and various other schematics. This aspect of the project is particularly significant, as it has proven to be instrumental throughout my career in software engineering.
