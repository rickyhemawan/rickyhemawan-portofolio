### Final Project

For my university's final project, I developed the Fresto App. The central
concept revolves around creating a restaurant reservation application. One of
its notable functionalities is the provision for restaurants to optionally
receive notifications indicating the customer's estimated arrival time, allowing
them to prepare meals promptly, even if the customer arrives slightly later than
the initially scheduled reservation time.

For my university's final project, I engineered a sophisticated system
integrating both backend and mobile development. This endeavor leveraged a
comprehensive tech stack, including Flutter and Node.js, alongside Express.js,
Google Maps API, and Firebase. It's worth noting that I independently acquired
proficiency in each of these technologies.

Additionally, I produced comprehensive design documents, including flow
diagrams, database-related diagrams, and various other schematics. This aspect
of the project is particularly significant, as it has proven to be instrumental
throughout my career in software engineering.
